# rust-embedded-lab

⚙️ Embedded Rust experiments and projects, aimed at mastering low-level, no_std, and real-time systems development.

## Projects

- [ ] GPIO LED blinker
- [ ] UART logger
- [ ] Sensor driver (I2C/SPI)
- [ ] Real-time signal analyzer
- [ ] USB HID device
- [ ] Rust-only bootloader
- [ ] Bare-metal RTOS playground
- [ ] DSP spike detection

Each project lives in its own folder under `projects/`.

## Goals

- Get comfortable with no_std and the embedded HAL ecosystem
- Build real-world microcontroller firmware in Rust
- Practice safe systems programming for neurotech applications
